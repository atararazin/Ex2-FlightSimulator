# Flight-Simulator-Desktop-App

## Intro
Before beginning, I must introduce the program that we used as a a client to our program - Flight Gear. Flight Gear is a free,
open-source program that anyone can download onto their computer (works for Mac, Windows and Linux). This program simulates a plane in 
various modes, such as taking off, landing and flying. It has many features such as viewing the plane from different angles, changing the 
time of day and even change the location! 

Take a look at their website: https://www.flightgear.org/
